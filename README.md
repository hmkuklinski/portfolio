# Welcome to my Personal Website!

I created this website with the intentions of showing my journey as a developer.<br>
[The Website](https://hannahkuklinski.vercel.app/)

## Table of Contents
1. [Navigating the Portfolio GitHub](#PortfolioGitHub)
2. [About Me](#About)
3. [Projects](#Projects)
4. [To Do](#ToDo)

# Portfolio GitHub
The files for my website are: index.html, index.css, and index.js <br>
*These files are used on my current website.*

The files for my original version are: PersonalWebsite.html PersonalWebsite.css <br>
*These files were created during my first month as a developer.*

# About
The first two sections of my website are all about me:
* what languages and skillsets I have
* connection links
* the story of why I started coding 
* my future goals.

Includes a navigation bar with useful links and a text display with a typing effect.

# Projects
This is the section I am most excited to share with others. 

It is a card based project display case, which includes a preview image of the project, a short description, important links, and language/framework tags. 

These tags allow for the user to search my project by language or framework used. Simply type in the language or framework that you like and hit the search button. 

It will filter out any project that does not have the searched language or framework tag.
